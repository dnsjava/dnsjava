dnsjava can be used in several ways:

Command line programs:

- dig: A clone of dig (as distributed with BIND)
	dig @server name type [class] [-p port]

- update:
	A dynamic update client with some extra functionality.  Rather than
	describing it all here, run 'help' from the command line.


Function calls:

- All functions are defined in the DNS package.

- All constants are defined in the dns class.  These include types, classes,
	flags, rcodes, and opcodes.  In most cases, there are functions to
	convert between numeric and string representations.

- High Level API:
	These are static methods in the dns class, and return 'dnsRecord []'

	getRecords(dnsResolver res, String name, short type, short dclass)
	getRecords(dnsResolver res, String name, short type)
	getRecords(String name, short type, short dclass)
	getRecords(String name, short type)
	getRecordsByAddress(dnsResolver res, String addr, short type)
	getRecordsByAddress(String addr, short type)

- Lower Level API

	Names:
		Names are normally represented by dnsName objects, which
		can be created from Strings.

	Records:
		Each record type is represented by a subclass of dnsRecord.
		For example, an A record is an instance of dnsARecord.  Each
		class has accessor functions which extract the data:
			dnsARecord.getName()
			dnsARecord.getType()
			dnsARecord.getDClass()
			dnsARecord.getAddress()
			(not all of the accessor functions are complete yet)
		Each class defines a constructor that takes all fields as
		parameters, and dnsRecord provides dnsRecord.newRecord()
		to create records in a non-type specific way.
	
	Messages:
		To extract the message header, use dnsMessage.getHeader().
		The header object supports:
			dnsHeader.getID() / dnsHeader.setID(id)
			dnsHeader.getFlag(flag)
			dnsHeader.setFlag(flag) / dnsHeader.unsetFlag(flag)
			dnsHeader.getRcode() / dnsHeader.setRcode(rcode)
			dnsHeader.getOpcode() / dnsHeader.setOpcode(opcode)
			dnsHeader.getCount()
		The message object supports:
			dnsMessage.addRecord(section, record)
			dnsMessage.removeRecord(section, record)
			dnsMessage.getSection(section)

	Resolver:
		dnsResolver.send(message) is used to send/receive messages.
		Resolver options can also be set:
			dnsResolver.setPort(port)
			dnsResolver.useTCP(flag)
			dnsResolver.setTSIGKey(name, key)

	See the dig client for a simple use of the resolver.
