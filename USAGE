dnsjava can be used in several ways:

Command line programs:

- dig:
	A clone of dig (as distributed with BIND)
	dig @server [-x] name type [class] [-p port] [-k name/secret] [-t] \
	[-i] [-e n] [-d]
		-x  : reverse lookup, name must be a dotted quad
		-k  : use TSIG transaction security
		-t  : use TCP by default
		-i  : ignore truncation errors
		-e n: Use EDNS level n (only 0 is defined)
		-d  : Set the DNSSEC OK bit

- update:
	A dynamic update client with some extra functionality.  This can be
	used either interactively or by specifying a file containing commands
	to be executed.  Running 'help' lists all other commands.
	update [file]


- jnamed:
	A basic authoritative only (non-caching, non-recursive) server.  It's
	not very good, but it's also a whole lot better than it used to be.

	The config file (jnamed.conf by default) supports the following
	directives:
		primary <zonename> <masterfile>
		secondary <zonename> <IP address>
		cache <hintfile>
		key <name> <base 64 encoded secret>
		address <IP address>
		port <port number>

	If no addresses are specified, jnamed will listen on all addresses,
	using a wildcard socket.  If no ports are specified, jnamed will
	listen on port 53.

	The following is an example:
		primary internal /etc/namedb/internal.db
		secondary xbill.org 127.0.0.1
		cache /etc/namedb/cache.db
		key xbill.org 1234
		address 127.0.0.1
		port 12345

	To run:
		jnamed [config_file]

	jnamed should not be used for production, and should probably
	not be used for testing.  If the above documentation is not enough,
	please do not ask for more, because it should not be used.

- lookup:
	A simple program that looks up records associated with names.
	If no type is specified, address lookups are done.

	lookup [-t type] name ...


DNS and DNS.utils packages:

- See the Javadoc documentation in doc/ for details

- All constants are defined in appropriate classes.  These include Type,
	Dclass, Flags, Rcode, Opcode, Section, Credibility, and Security.
	In many cases, there are functions to convert between numeric and
	string representations (Type.string(value) and Type.value(string)).

- High Level API:

	A number of static methods in dns and Address that perform DNS lookups
	and cache the results.

- Low Level API

	Name:
		Names are normally represented by Name objects, which
		can be created from Strings.

	Record:
		Each record type is represented by a subclass of Record.
		Each class has accessor functions which extract the data.

		To create new Records, each class defines a constructor that
		takes all fields as parameters, and Record provides
		Record.newRecord() to create records in a general way.

	RRset:
		A set of records with the same Name and type.  The important
		function is rrs(), which creates an Iterator.

	Messages:
		A Header and a collection of records comprising the message.

	Resolver:
		An interface implemented by SimpleResolver and ExtendedResolver.
		SimpleResolver only communicates with one server, and does
		no retries.  ExtendedResolver communicates with multiple
		servers and sends retries if queries fail.

		Resolver.send(message) is used to send/receive messages.

		Resolver.sendAsync(message, ResolverListener) sends a message
		whose answer will be delivered asynchronously.  The
		ResolverListener interface defines:
			receiveMessage(int id, Message m)
		where 'id' is returned by sendAsync.

		Resolver options can also be set:
			Resolver.setPort(port)
			Resolver.useTCP(flag)
			Resolver.setTSIGKey(name, key)
			Resolver.setTimeout(secs)
			Resolver.setIgnoreTruncation(flag)
		See the dig client for a sample use of the resolver.

		SimpleResolver can be initialized by SimpleResolver() to use
		a default server or SimpleResolver(String) to specify the
		server.

		ExtendedResolver can be initialized by ExtendedResolver() to
		use default servers, or ExtendedResolver(String []) or
		ExtendedResolver(resolver []) to specify servers or resolvers.

		ExtendedResolver.addResolver(resolver) and
		ExtendedResolver.deleteResolver(resolver) modify the set
		of Resolvers used by an Extended Resolver.

		ExtendedResolver.getResolvers() and
		ExtendedResolver.getResolver(i) are used to obtain its
		resolver(s).

	Cache:
		Records (as RRsets) are added with:
			addRRset(RRset r, byte cred)
		Records are looked up with:
			lookupRecords(Name name, short type, byte minCred)
		which returns a CacheResponse, or
			findRecords(Name name, short type)
			findAnyRecords(Name name, short type)
		which return an array of RRsets.

	DNSSEC:
		Use of DNSSEC is slightly complicated, to avoid creating
		dependencies in the mainline code.  An implementation of a
		Verifier must be created and assigned to a Cache.  The
		Verifier must be seeded with trusted keys, or else no
		data will ever be considered secure.  Finally, if only
		secure data is desired, the cache must be instructed to
		use this policy:

		DNSSECVerifier v = new DNSSECVerifier();
		cache.setVerifier(v);
		v.addTrustedKey(key);
		cache.setSecurePolicy();

		From this point on, all data will be checked for DNSSEC
		validity before entering the cache.
