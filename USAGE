dnsjava can be used in several ways:

Command line programs:

- dig: A clone of dig (as distributed with BIND)
	dig @server name type [class] [-p port]

- update:
	A dynamic update client with some extra functionality.  Rather than
	describing it all here, run 'help' from the command line.

- jnamed:
	A basic primary, non-caching, non-recursive server.  Not very good,
	but it runs now.  The config file specifies "primary file",
	"cache file", and "key name data".
	jnamed config_file

Function calls:

- All functions are defined in the DNS package.

- All constants are defined in appropriate classes.  These include Type,
	Dclass, Flags, Rcode, Opcode, and Section.  In most cases, there are
	functions to convert between numeric and string representations
	(Type.string(value) and Type.value(string)).

- High Level API:
	These are static methods in the dns class that return 'Record []'

	getRecords(Resolver res, String name, short type, short dclass)
	getRecords(Resolver res, String name, short type)
	getRecords(String name, short type, short dclass)
	getRecords(String name, short type)
	getRecordsByAddress(Resolver res, String addr, short type)
	getRecordsByAddress(String addr, short type)

- Lower Level API

	Names:
		Names are normally represented by Name objects, which
		can be created from Strings.

	Records:
		Each record type is represented by a subclass of dnsRecord.
		Each class has accessor functions which extract the data.
		For example, an A record is an instance of ARecord:
			ARecord.getName()
			ARecord.getType()
			ARecord.getDClass()
			ARecord.getAddress()
			(not all of the accessor functions are complete yet)
		Each class defines a constructor that takes all fields as
		parameters, and Record provides Record.newRecord()
		to create records in a non-type specific way.
	
	Messages:
		To extract the message header, use Message.getHeader().
		The header object supports:
			Header.getID() / Header.setID(id)
			Header.getFlag(flag)
			Header.setFlag(flag) / Header.unsetFlag(flag)
			Header.getRcode() / Header.setRcode(rcode)
			Header.getOpcode() / Header.setOpcode(opcode)
			Header.getCount()
		The message object supports:
			Message.addRecord(section, record)
			Message.removeRecord(section, record)
			Message.getSection(section)

	Resolver:
		dnsResolver.send(message) is used to send/receive messages.
		Resolver options can also be set:
			Resolver.setPort(port)
			Resolver.useTCP(flag)
			Resolver.setTSIGKey(name, key)

	See the dig client for a simple use of the resolver.
