	  timeout was not properly obeyed.
	  (reported by Peter Bryant <peter@pingability.com>)

5/7/2005
	- Fix several problems with empty names.
	  (Matt Rutherford <rutherfo@cs.colorado.edu>)

4/23/2005

	  number of improvements, most visibly improved timeouts.
	- Remove deprecated dns class.
	- Simplify TSIG initialization; remove functions that should
	  have never existed.

	  work.
	- Change the Zone constructors/factory methods to be consistent.

	  (Madhu Siddalingaiah <madhu@madhu.com>)

3/20/2004

12/6/2003
	- Make the J2SE javadoc link a property in build.xml.  (Ville SkyttÃ¤)

11/24/2003
	- Lookup should check that the name, type, and class in the question
	  section of a response match that of the query.
	- SimpleResolver should check that the message id of the response
	  is the same as the message id of the query.  On a sufficiently
	  busy client, sockets can be reused fast enough that late responses
	  can come in, and should be ignored.
	  (seen by Joseph Shraibman <jks@iname.com>)

11/17/2003
	- The Lookup code didn't handle CNAMEs pointing at nonexistant names.
	  (reported by Joseph Shraibman <jks@iname.com>)

	  kill the thread when the Cache is finalized.
	  (suggested by Joseph Shraibman <jks@iname.com>)

	- When a Lookup uses a null cache, the temporary cache it creates
	  should not have a CacheCleaner thread.
	  (based on a suggestion by Joseph Shraibman <jks@iname.com>)

10/31/2003
	- Record.hashCode() didn't return consistent hash codes, and didn't
	  ignore the TTL (which it should, and which Record.equals() does).

10/27/2003
	- DNS TTLs and other 32 bit unsigned values are now represented as
	  longs, not ints.  This is an API change, but allows the full range
	  to be used.
	- Add the Serial class for serial arithmetic.

9/30/2003
	- 1.4.3 released.
	- Fix a bit of code that required Java 1.4.

9/29/2003
	- 1.4.2 released.

9/26/2003
	- A Lookup shouldn't die when receiving a referral response; it should
	  return an error. (reported by Elinor Chang <elinor_chang@yahoo.com>)
	- A Lookup should distinguish between timeouts and other network
	  errors.
	- When parsing IP addresses from text format, treat the presence of
	  a leading zero on an octet as an error.  It's unclear whether
	  it would be treated as decimal or octal, which means it should
	  be fixed. (reported by Marcos Sanz/Denic <sanz@denic.de>)

9/17/2003
	- Fix an off-by-one error in the Name code; labels of length 63

	- Change Record.fromString() to expect an EOL/EOF token at the end
	  of the string, so that extraneous tokens can be detected.  The master
	  file parser was updated to this change.
	  (noticed by Bob Halley <bob.halley@nominum.com>)

8/22/2003
	- Changing TXTRecord.getStrings() from returning a List of Strings
	  to a List of byte []'s was a bad idea.  Change it back, and
	  add TXTRecord.getStringsAsByteArrays().
	  (reported by Blake Ramsdell <blake@brutesquadlabs.com>)

8/21/2003
	- 1.4.0 released.

8/20/2003
	- Add the ReverseMap class, which contains functions to construct
	  names to be used in reverse map zones.

8/13/2003
	- When looking up a one label unqualified name which fails to match
	  all searchlist entries, don't append the root label and try again.
	  This is recommended by RFC 1536, section 6: "Only if the name, so
	  generated, returns an NXDOMAIN is the original name tried as a Fully
	  Qualified Domain Name. And only if it contains at least one period."

	- Remove lots of unused imports. (Jared Richardson <jaredr@nc.rr.com>)

	  were incorrectly handled
	  (reported by Kevin C Miller <kevinm@andrew.cmu.edu>

6/22/2003
	- DNS types and classes are now represented as ints, not shorts.
	  This is an API change, but allows the full type/class range
	  to be used.

6/18/2003
	- Quoted strings didn't handle \ddd escapes.

6/17/2003
	- Fix an ArrayIndexOutofBoundsException triggered by load balancing

	  a name relative to a specified origin.
	- Add the Update class, which contains helper routines used to
	  construct dynamic update messages.

5/28/2003
	- Replace org.xbill.DNS.utils.MyStringTokenizer with
	  org.xbill.DNS.Tokenizer, which is a far more robust and correct
	  DNS tokenizer.  Convert everything to use it.
	- Fix text format of TXT, NAPTR, and HINFO records.

5/28/2003
	- When constructing a record, check that all names are absolute.

	- Make the routine that converts an IP address from a string
	  more efficient and correct.
	  (based on a patch by Sean O'Neil <SeanO@telemate.net>)

	  this method will properly truncate large responses and apply
	  TSIG signatures.

12/14/2002
	- Move additional data processing to the Record class from jnamed;
	  make jnamed use it, as well as the caching code.

12/9/2002
	- Add the Lookup class, which is what the dns class should have been,

	  a RuntimeException, the ExtendedResolver would throw a
	  ClassCastException.   It should rethrow the RuntimeException.

12/3/2002
	- The Name code didn't handle names with non-printable characters.
	  (found by Serge Sozonoff <serge@globalbeach.com>)
