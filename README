Overview:

dnsjava is an implementation of DNS in Java.  It supports all of the common
record types and the DNSSEC types.  It can be used for queries, zone transfers,
and dynamic updates.  It includes a cache which can be used by clients, and a
minimal implementation of a server.  It supports TSIG authenticated messages
(if you don't know, don't worry about it).

dnsjava is designed to be a complete replacement for the DNS functionality
provided by the InetAddress class.  Since it is written in pure Java, dnsjava
is fully threadable.

dnsjava was started as an excuse to learn Java.  It was useful for testing new
features in BIND without rewriting the C resolver.  It was then cleaned up and
extended in order to be used as a testing framework for the DNS
interoperability testing at the 44th IETF.  The high level API was added to
make it useful to a wider audience.


Limitations:

There's no way to determine what the local nameserver is at runtime from within
the JVM.  First, the properties 'dns.server1',  'dns.server2', etc. are
checked.  These can either be IP addresses or hostnames (which are resolved
using Java's built in DNS support).  If the underlying OS is unix-based, the
dnsjava package can parse /etc/resolv.conf and determine the nameservers.  If
the property is not defined and the OS is not unix-based, the default
nameserver is "localhost".  This is very bad.  Unfortuantely, I have no idea
how to determine the nameserver under Windows, MacOS, etc.  Contributions of
code are welcome (see DNS/FindResolver.java for the basic structure).

One some machines, InetAddress.getLocalHost() returns 127.0.0.1.  This is
usually caused by a bug in the JVM, and often happens when the machine has
a dynamic address and its hostname is not in DNS.  If the @me@ variable
is present in the textual form of an A record and InetAddress.getLocalHost()
doesn't work, dnsjava will print an error and die.  I'm investigating
ways to improve this behavior without using JNI.

Not all of the record types are supported.  Most other types are deprecated or
rarely used.


Additional documentation:

Javadoc (1.2) documentation is provided in the doc/ subdirectory.


Future:

- A GUI for the dynamic update program would be nice
